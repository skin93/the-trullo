# The Trullo

Project management site built with React & Firebase based on The Net Ninja course.

We can:

- register & login as a user
- add projects, filter them and display on the dashboard page
- add comments
- see what user is actually online
- delete a project if completed

In my version of the app I've used the following technologies:

- React v17, React Router v6, React Hook Form v7, React Select
- Firebase v8.5
- styled-components, yup

App was deployed to Firebase Hosting
